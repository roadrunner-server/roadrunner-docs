# App server â€” CLI Commands

RoadRunner offers a convenient CLI to start and manage the server.

## Version

To display the version of RoadRunner, you can use the `-v` or `--version` option:

```terminal
./rr -v
```

This command will display the version of RoadRunner, as well as information about the build time, operating system, and
architecture.

```output
rr version local (build time: development, go1.18.3), OS: linux, arch: amd64
```

## Starting the Server

To start the server, you can use the following command:

```terminal
./rr serve 
```

By default, RoadRunner looks for a `.rr.yaml` file in the current working directory where the binary is placed. However,
you can also specify the configuration file from a different location using the `-c` option:

```terminal
./rr serve -c /var/www/.rr.yaml
```

You can also specify the working directory using the -w option:

```terminal
./rr serve -w /var/www
```

RoadRunner also supports `.env` files. To read environment variables from the `.env` file, use the `--dotenv` CLI
command:

```terminal
./rr serve --dotenv .env -c .rr.yaml
```

### Background mode

Additionally, you can start the server in the background mode using the `-p` option. In this mode, RoadRunner creates
a `.pid` file:

```terminal
./rr serve -p
```

### Debug mode

RoadRunner also supports running the Golang pprof server in debug mode using the `-d` option. This option enables the
debug mode, which starts the pprof server and listens for incoming requests on the configured port.

```terminal
./rr serve -d -c .rr.yaml
```

### Available options

- `-c` - specifies the path to the configuration file. By default, RoadRunner looks for a .rr.yaml file in the current
  working directory. However, you can specify a different file using this option.
- `-w` - sets the working directory for the server. By default, RoadRunner uses the current working directory.
- `--dotenv` - populates the process with environment variables from the .dotenv file. This can be useful when you want
  to set environment variables for your application.
- `-d` - starts a Golang pprof server in debug mode. This allows you to analyze the performance of your application and
  identify potential bottlenecks.
- `-s` - enables silent mode. In this mode, RoadRunner does not display any output in the console.
- `-o` - allows you to override configuration keys with your values. For example, -o=http.address=:8080 will override
  the http.address configuration key from the .rr.yaml file.
- `-p` - creates a .pid file to use with the rr stop command later. This can be useful when you want to run RoadRunner
  in the background mode.

## Stopping the Server

To stop RoadRunner, you have a few options:

- You can send a `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` system call to the main RoadRunner process. Inside a Kubernetes environment, this
  is done automatically when you're stopping the pod.
- If you want to stop RoadRunner manually, you can hit `ctrl+c` for a graceful stop or hit `ctrl+c` one more time to
  force stop.

You can also use the following command to stop the server:

```terminal
./rr stop
```

If you want to force stop the server, you can use the `-f` option:

```terminal
./rr stop -f
```

### Available options

- `-f` - force stop.
- `-s` - silent mode.

## Reloading workers

RoadRunner allows you to reload all workers.

```terminal
./rr reset
```

This command reloads all RoadRunner workers, including HTTP, GRPC, and other, and starts them with a new worker pool.
This can be useful when you make changes to your application code and want to see the changes reflected in the running
server.

By default, this command displays output in the console. However, if you want to reload the workers silently, you can
use the `--silent` option:

```terminal
./rr reset --silent
```

> **Note**
> You can attach this command as a file watcher in your IDE.

Additionally, you can reload only particular plugins by specifying their names:

```terminal
./rr reset http
```

> **Note**
> RoadRunner will wait for any active requests to finish processing before reloading the worker pool. This ensures that
> all active requests are completed before the new worker pool is started.
> Any new incoming requests that arrive during the reloading process will be queued and processed once the new worker
> pool is started. This means that there may be a temporary delay in processing new requests while the worker pool is
> being reloaded, but no requests should be lost.

### Available options

- `-c` - specifies the path to the configuration file. By default, RoadRunner looks for a .rr.yaml file in the current
  working directory. However, you can specify a different file using this option.

## Workers status (OS metrics)

RoadRunner provides a command to view the status of active workers. You can use this command to monitor the health and
performance of your workers and diagnose any issues.

```terminal
./rr workers
```

This command displays a table with the status of all workers, including their PID, status, number of executions, memory
usage, and creation time.

```output
Workers of [jobs]:
+---------+-----------+---------+---------+---------+--------------------+
|   PID   |  STATUS   |  EXECS  | MEMORY  |  CPU%   |      CREATED       |
+---------+-----------+---------+---------+---------+--------------------+
|    3458 | ready     |       0 | 45 MB   |    0.00 | 1 day ago          |
|    3460 | ready     |       0 | 45 MB   |    0.00 | 1 day ago          |
|    3461 | ready     |       0 | 46 MB   |    0.00 | 1 day ago          |
|    3462 | ready     |       0 | 46 MB   |    0.00 | 1 day ago          |
+---------+-----------+---------+---------+---------+--------------------+

Workers of [http]:
+---------+-----------+---------+---------+---------+--------------------+
|   PID   |  STATUS   |  EXECS  | MEMORY  |  CPU%   |      CREATED       |
+---------+-----------+---------+---------+---------+--------------------+
|    3454 | ready     |     396 | 79 MB   |    0.04 | 1 day ago          |
+---------+-----------+---------+---------+---------+--------------------+
```

You can also specify plugin names to view the status of workers for a particular plugin:

```terminal
./rr workers http
```

Use the `-i` option to enable interactive mode. In this mode, the command will update the statistics every second:

```terminal
./rr workers -i
```

This command is useful for debugging performance issues and identifying workers that are not performing as expected.
Additionally, you can use this command to monitor the health of your workers and identify any potential problems before
they become critical.

> **Note**
> When the `pool.debug` configuration option is set to `true`, the `rr workers` command will not display any workers in
> the pool. This is because workers are only created when incoming requests arrive, so there may not be any active
> workers at the time when the command is executed.

### Available options

- `-c` - specifies the path to the configuration file. By default, RoadRunner looks for a .rr.yaml file in the current
  working directory. However, you can specify a different file using this option.
- `-w` - sets the working directory for the server. By default, RoadRunner uses the current working directory.
- `-i` - interactive mode (update statistic every second).

## Jobs commands

RoadRunner provides several CLI commands to manage jobs and pipelines.

:::: tabs

::: tab Pause

This command allows you to specify one or more pipelines to `pause`. For example, to pause pipelines `pipeline1` and
`pipeline2`, you can use the following command:

```terminal
./rr jobs pause pipeline1,pipeline2
```

:::

::: tab Resume

This command allows you to specify one or more pipelines to `resume`. For example, to resume pipelines `pipeline1` and
`pipeline2`, you can use the following command:

```terminal
./rr jobs resume pipeline1,pipeline2
```

:::

::: tab Stop

This command allows you to specify one or more pipelines to `stop`. For example, to stop pipelines `pipeline1` and
`pipeline2`, you can use the following command:

```terminal
./rr jobs stop pipeline1,pipeline2
```

:::

::::

To list all running pipelines, you can use the following command:

```terminal
./rr jobs list
```

To show the rr version, use `-v` or `--version`:

```bash
rr -v
```

### Available options

- `-c` - specifies the path to the configuration file. By default, RoadRunner looks for a `.rr.yaml` file in the current
  working directory. However, you can specify a different file using this option.

## RoadRunner client

The `reset`, `workers`, and `jobs` commands use RoadRunner's RPC interface to interact with the server, and the
connection information is obtained from the configuration file.

This means that you can use a local RoadRunner binary as a client to connect to a remote server, as long as the server's
host and port information is specified in the local configuration. This can be useful in situations where you want to
manage a remote RoadRunner instance from your local machine.

To specify the server `host` and `port` information, you can use the `rpc` section of the `.rr.yaml` file.

For example:

```yaml .rr.yaml
rpc:
  listen: "127.0.0.1:6001"
```
