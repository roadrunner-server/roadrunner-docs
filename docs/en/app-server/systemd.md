# App server â€” Running server as daemon on Linux

Here you can find an example of systemd unit file that can be used to run RoadRunner as a daemon on
a server:

```ini
[Unit]
Description = High-performance PHP application server

[Service]
Type = simple
ExecStart = /usr/local/bin/rr serve -c /var/www/.rr.yaml
Restart = always
RestartSec = 30

[Install]
WantedBy = default.target 
``` 

Where is

- `/usr/local/bin/rr` - path to the RoadRunner binary file
- `/var/www/.rr.yaml` - path to the RoadRunner configuration file

> **Warning**
> These paths are just examples, and the actual paths may differ depending on the specific
> server configuration and file locations. You should update these paths to match the actual paths used in your server
> setup.

You should also update the `ExecStart` option with your own configuration and save the file with a suitable name,
such as `rr.service`. Usually, such user unit files are located in the `.config/systemd/user/` directory. To enable the
service, you should run the following commands:

```bash
systemctl enable --user rr.service
```

and

```bash
systemctl start rr.service
``` 

This will start RoadRunner as a daemon on the server.
