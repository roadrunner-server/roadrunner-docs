# Installation

The easiest way to get the latest RoadRunner version is to use one of the pre-built release binaries, which are available for
OSX, Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows. Instructions for using these binaries are on the GitHub [releases page](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/releases).

FROM php:8.2-cli

COPY --from=roadrunner /usr/bin/rr /usr/local/bin/rr
