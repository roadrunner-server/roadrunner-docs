# Installation
The easiest way to get the latest RoadRunner version is to use one of the pre-built release binaries which are available for
OSX, Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows. Instructions for using these binaries are on the GitHub [releases page](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/releases).

## Docker:

To get the roadrunner binary file you can use our docker image: `spiralscout/roadrunner:2.X.X` (more information about
image and tags can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/spiralscout/roadrunner/)) or use the GitHub package: `ghcr.io/roadrunner-server/roadrunner:2.X.X`

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/roadrunner-server/roadrunner:2.X.X AS roadrunner
FROM php:8.1-cli

COPY --from=roadrunner /usr/bin/rr /usr/local/bin/rr

# USE THE RR
```

Configuration located in the `.rr.yaml` file ([full sample](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/blob/master/.rr.yaml)):


## Installation via Composer
You can also install RoadRunner automatically using command shipped with the composer package, run:

```bash
$ composer require spiral/roadrunner:v2.0 nyholm/psr7
$ ./vendor/bin/rr get-binary
```

Server binary will be available at the root of your project.
