# RoadRunner — Installation

There are several ways to install RoadRunner, depending on your needs and preferences.

## Pre-built Binaries

The simplest way to get the latest version of RoadRunner is to download one of the pre-built release binaries, which are
available for various operating systems, including macOS, Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows. You can find these binaries on
the GitHub [releases page](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/releases).

To install RoadRunner just download the appropriate archive from the releases page and extract it into your desired
application directory.

## Docker

If you prefer to use RoadRunner inside a Docker container, you can use the official RoadRunner Docker
image `ghcr.io/roadrunner-server/roadrunner:latest`.

> **Note**
> More information about available tags can be
> found [here](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/pkgs/container/roadrunner).

**Here is an example of usage**

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/roadrunner-server/roadrunner:2023.X.X AS roadrunner
FROM php:8.2-cli

COPY --from=roadrunner /usr/bin/rr /usr/local/bin/rr

# Install and configure your application
# ...

CMD rr serve -c .rr.yaml
```

> **Warning**
> Don't forget to replace `2023.X.X` with desired version of RoadRunner.

## Composer

If you use Composer to manage your PHP dependencies, you can install the `spiral/roadrunner-cli` package to download the
latest version of RoadRunner to your project's root directory.

**Install the package**

```terminal
composer require spiral/roadrunner-cli
```

Run the following command to download the latest version of RoadRunner

Server binary will be available at the root of your project.

> **Warning**
