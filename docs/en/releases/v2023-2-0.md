- ✒️ **Docker builds**: New tags: `v2023`, `v2023.x` and with bugfix: `v2023.x.x`. The `latest` tag points to the latest **stable** release. All `rc`, `beta`, `alpha` releases will no longer be tagged with `latest`.

- ✒️ **Temporal plugin, internal**: Pass `history_len` to the PHP worker and get the PHP-SDK version to pass to the Temporal server. 
- ✒️ **Lock plugin**: Completely rewritten. Now supports a microsecond interval. Any `ttl/wait_ttl` value passed to RR is now treated as **microseconds**. There is no configuration for this plugin, it is bundled with RR.
- ✒️ **Service plugin**: Add a new option for the graceful process timeout: `timeout_stop_sec`. RR will wait for the specified amount of time (but not more than `endure.graceful_period`) for the process to stop, [FR](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/issues/1628), (thanks @asanikovich)

- 🐛 **Service plugin**: Incorrect parsing and assignment of the `process_num` value passed via RPC: [BUG](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/issues/1621), (thanks @asanikovich)
