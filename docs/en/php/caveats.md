# Caveats

## Uploading Files
Since file-upload is handled on RR end PHP process will only receive the filename of temporary resources.
This resource would not be registered in `uploaded files` hash and, as a result, function `is_uploaded_file` will always return `false`.

## Exit and Die functions
Please note that you should not use any of the following methods `die`, `exit`. Use buffered output if your library requires writing content to stdout.

## WinCache
Using roadrunner on Windows with the WinCache extension might cause the worker bytecode to get stuck in memory.
