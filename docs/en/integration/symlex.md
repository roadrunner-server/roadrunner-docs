[Symlex](https://symlex.org/) is a lean framework stack for agile Web development based on Symfony and Vuetify.
RoadRunner is used as default application server since version 4.4.0.

**The GitHub repository contains everything to get you started: [symlex/symlex](https://github.com/symlex/symlex)**

Since its initial release in 2014, it has proven to be well suited for rapidly building microservices, CLI and
single-page applications. It comes complete with working examples from testing to forms and database abstraction.
