```

## HTTPS

You can enable HTTPS support by adding `ssl` section into `http` config.

```yaml
version: "3"

http:
  address: 127.0.0.1:8080

  ssl:
    # host and port separated by semicolon (default :443)
    address: :8892
    redirect: false
    cert: fixtures/server.crt
    key: fixtures/server.key
    root_ca: root.crt
```

### Let's Encrypt

RR can automatically obtain TLS certificates for your domain. The folder with your certs might be moved between servers,
RR will check the `certs_dir` and obtain a new certificate if the old one is above to expire. 

RR will track your certificate's expiration date and refresh it automatically.

```yaml .rr.yaml
version: "3"

http:
  # other HTTP sections are omitted 
  # .......

  ssl:
    address: '0.0.0.0:443'
    # ACME section
    #
    # TLS provider
    acme:
      # directory to store your certificate and key from the LE
      #
      # Default: rr_cache_dir
      certs_dir: rr_le_certs
      # Your email
      #
      # Mandatory. Error on empty.
      email: you-email-here@email
      # Alternate port for the HTTP challenge (make sure, that you redirected traffic to the specified port from 80)
      #
      # Default: 80
      alt_http_port: 80
      # Alternate port for the TLS-ALPN challenge (make sure, that you redirected traffic to the specified port from 443)
      #
      # Default: 443
      alt_tlsalpn_port: 443
      # Challenge type to use
      #
      # Default: http-01
      challenge_type: http-01
      # Use staging or production endpoint
      #
      # Would be a good practice to test your setup, before obtaining a real certificate
      use_production_endpoint: false
      # List of your domains
      #
      # Mandatory. Error on empty
      domains:
        - your-cool-domains.here

  # other HTTP sections are omitted
  # ........
```

### mTLS

To enable [mTLS](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/access-management/what-is-mutual-tls/) use the following
configuration:

```yaml .rr.yaml
http:
  pool:
    num_workers: 1
    max_jobs: 0
    allocate_timeout: 60s
    destroy_timeout: 60s
  ssl:
    address: :8895
    key: "server-key.pem"
    cert: "server-cert.pem"
    root_ca: "rootCA.pem"
    client_auth_type: require_and_verify_client_cert 
```

**Options for the `client_auth_type` are:**

- `request_client_cert`
- `require_any_client_cert`
- `verify_client_cert_if_given`
- `require_and_verify_client_cert`
- `no_client_certs`

### Redirecting HTTP to HTTPS

To enable an automatic redirect from `http://` to `https://` set `redirect` option to `true` (disabled by default).

### Root certificate authority support

Root CA supported by the option in `.rr.yaml`

```yaml
version: "3"

http:
  ssl:
    root_ca: root.crt
```

## HTTP/2

You can enable HTTP2 support by adding `http2` section into `http` config.

```yaml
version: "3"

http:
  address: 127.0.0.1:8080

  http2:
    h2c: false
    max_concurrent_streams: 128
```

### Upgrade connection from `http1.1` to `h2c` [`v2.10.2`]

Connection might be upgraded from the `http/1.1`
to `h2c`: [rfc7540](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7540#section-3.4)

**Headers, which should be sent to upgrade connection:**

1. `Upgrade`: `h2c`
2. `Connection`: `HTTP2-Settings`
3. `Connection`: `Upgrade`
4. `HTTP2-Settings`: `AAMAAABkAARAAAAAAAIAAAAA` [RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7540#section-3.2.1)

### HTTP/2 Push Resources

RoadRunner support [HTTP/2 push](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2_Server_Push) via virtual headers provided by PHP
response.

```php
return $response->withAddedHeader('http2-push', '/test.js');
```

Note that the path of the resource must be related to the public application directory and must include `/` at the
beginning.

> **Note**
> HTTP2 push only works under HTTPS with `static` service enabled.

### H2C

You can enable HTTP/2 support over non-encrypted TCP connection using H2C:

```yaml
version: "3"

http:
  http2.h2c: true
```

## FastCGI

There is FastCGI frontend support inside the HTTP module, you can enable it (disabled by default):

```yaml
version: "3"

http:
  fcgi:
    # FastCGI connection DSN. Supported TCP and Unix sockets.
    address: tcp://0.0.0.0:6920
```

## Overriding HTTP default error code

```yaml
version: "3"

http:
  # override http error code for the internal RR errors (default 500)
  internal_error_code: 505
```

`http.internal_error_code` code is used for the `SoftJob`, allocation, all kinds of TTL, Network, errors. But for
example, for the load balancer might be better to use a different code. So, you may override the default one.

## Middleware order

Since all middleware are independent, they can remove/update headers set by
the [previous one](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/issues/1501).

**Note that the request (imagine) comes from the right:**

```yaml
http:
  middleware: # RESPONSE FROM HERE --> [ "static", "gzip", "sendfile" ] # <-- REQUEST COMES FROM HERE
```

So in this case the request gets into the `sendfile` middleware, then `gzip` and `static`. And vice versa from the
response.
