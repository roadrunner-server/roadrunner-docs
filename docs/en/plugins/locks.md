# Plugins â€” Lock

The RoadRunner lock plugin is a powerful tool that enables you to manage distributed locks in their applications using
the RPC protocol. By leveraging the benefits of using GO with PHP, it provides a lightweight, fast, and reliable way to
acquire, release, and manage locks in a distributed environment. With this plugin, you can easily manage critical
sections of your application and prevent race conditions, data corruption, and other synchronization issues that can
occur in multi-process environments.

> **Warning**
> RoadRunner lock plugin uses an in-memory storage to store information about locks at this moment. When multiple
> instances of RoadRunner are used, each instance will have its own in-memory storage for locks. As a result, if a
> process
> acquires a lock on one instance of RoadRunner, it will not be aware of the lock state on the other instances.

## PHP client

The RoadRunner lock plugin comes with a convenient PHP package that simplifies the process of integrating the
plugin with your PHP application.

### Installation

To get started, you can install the package via Composer using the following command:

```terminal
composer require roadrunner-php/lock
```

### Usage

After the installation, you can create an instance of the `RoadRunner\Lock\Lock` class, which will allow you to use the
available class methods.

**Here is an example:**

```php
use RoadRunner\Lock\Lock;
use Spiral\Goridge\RPC\RPC;

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$lock = new Lock(RPC::create('tcp://127.0.0.1:6001'));
```

> **Warning**
> To interact with the RoadRunner lock plugin, you will need to have the RPC defined in the rpc configuration
> section. You can refer to the documentation page [here](../php/rpc.md) to learn more about the configuration and
> installation.

The `RoadRunner\Lock\Lock` class provides four methods that allow you to manage locks:

#### Acquire lock

Locks a resource so that it can be accessed by one process at a time. When a resource is locked, other processes that
attempt to lock the same resource will be blocked until the lock is released.

```php
$id = $lock->lock('pdf:create');

// Acquire lock with ttl - 10 seconds
$id = $lock->lock('pdf:create', ttl: 10);
// or
$id = $lock->lock('pdf:create', ttl: new \DateInterval('PT10S'));

// Acquire lock and wait 5 seconds until lock will be released
$id = $lock->lock('pdf:create', wait: 5);
// or
$id = $lock->lock('pdf:create', wait: new \DateInterval('PT5S'));

// Acquire lock with id - 14e1b600-9e97-11d8-9f32-f2801f1b9fd1
$id = $lock->lock('pdf:create', id: '14e1b600-9e97-11d8-9f32-f2801f1b9fd1');
```

#### Acquire read lock

Locks a resource for shared access, allowing multiple processes to access the resource simultaneously. When a resource
is locked for shared access, other processes that attempt to lock the resource for exclusive access will be blocked
until all shared locks are released.

```php
$id = $lock->lockRead('pdf:create', ttl: 10);
// or
$id = $lock->lockRead('pdf:create', ttl: new \DateInterval('PT10S'));

// Acquire lock and wait 5 seconds until lock will be released
$id = $lock->lockRead('pdf:create', wait: 5);
// or
$id = $lock->lockRead('pdf:create', wait: new \DateInterval('PT5S'));

// Acquire lock with id - 14e1b600-9e97-11d8-9f32-f2801f1b9fd1
$id = $lock->lockRead('pdf:create', id: '14e1b600-9e97-11d8-9f32-f2801f1b9fd1');
```

#### Release lock

Releases an exclusive lock or read lock on a resource that was previously acquired by a call to `lock()`
or `lockRead()`.

```php
// Release lock after task is done.
$lock->release('pdf:create', $id);

// Force release lock
$lock->forceRelease('pdf:create');
```

#### Check lock

Checks if a resource is currently locked and returns information about the lock.

```php
$status = $lock->exists('pdf:create');
if($status) {
    // Lock exists
} else {
    // Lock not exists
}
```

#### Update TTL

Updates the time-to-live (TTL) for the locked resource.

```php
// Add 10 seconds to lock ttl
$lock->updateTTL('pdf:create', $id, 10);
// or
$lock->updateTTL('pdf:create', $id, new \DateInterval('PT10S'));
```

## API

### Protobuf API

To make it easy to use the Lock proto API in PHP, we provide
a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/roadrunner-php/roadrunner-api-dto), that contains all the generated
PHP DTO classes proto files, making it easy to work with these files in your PHP application.

### RPC API

RoadRunner provides an RPC API, which allows you to manage distributed locks in your applications using remote
procedure calls. The RPC API provides a set of methods that map to the available methods of the `RoadRunner\Lock\Lock`
class in PHP.

#### Lock

Acquires an exclusive lock on a resource so that it can be accessed by one process at a time. When a resource is locked,
other processes that attempt to lock the same resource will be blocked until the lock is released.

```go
func (r *rpc) Lock(req *lockApi.Request, resp *lockApi.Response) error {}
```

#### LockRead

Acquires a read lock on a resource, allowing multiple processes to access the resource simultaneously. When a resource
is locked for shared access, other processes that attempt to lock the resource for exclusive access will be blocked
until all shared locks are released.

```go
func (r *rpc) LockRead(req *lockApi.Request, resp *lockApi.Response) error {}
```

#### Release

Releases an exclusive lock or a read lock on a resource that was previously acquired by a call to `Lock` or `LockRead`.

```go
func (r *rpc) Release(req *lockApi.Request, resp *lockApi.Response) error {}
```

#### ForceRelease

Releases all locks on a resource, regardless of which process acquired them.

```go
func (r *rpc) ForceRelease(req *lockApi.Request, resp *lockApi.Response) error {}
```

#### Exists

Checks if a resource is currently locked and returns information about the lock.

```go
func (r *rpc) Exists(req *lockApi.Request, resp *lockApi.Response) error {}
```

#### UpdateTTL

Updates the time-to-live (TTL) for the locked resource.

```go
func (r *rpc) UpdateTTL(req *lockApi.Request, resp *lockApi.Response) error {}
```
