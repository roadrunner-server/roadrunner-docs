# KV Plugin â€” Memory Driver

This type of driver is already supported by the RoadRunner and does not require any additional installations.

> **Warning**
> This type of storage, all data is contained in memory and will be destroyed when the RoadRunner Server is restarted.
> If you need persistent storage without additional dependencies, then it is recommended to use the boltdb driver.

## Configuration

The complete memory driver configuration:

```yaml
version: "3"

kv:
  # User defined name of the storage.
  memory:
    # Required section.
    # Should be "memory" for the memory driver.
    driver: memory
    config: {}
```

There are no additional configuration options for this driver. The `in-memory` driver will automatically create callbacks for items with TTL.
