# Jobs â€” Kafka driver

Kafka driver supported since RoadRunner version `2.11.0`. The Kafka driver has been reworked in `v2023.1.0`.
Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming system used for event stream processing, real-time data pipelines, and
large-scale stream processing.
Originally developed and open-sourced at LinkedIn in 2011, Kafka has quickly evolved from a messaging queue to a
full-fledged event streaming platform.
Now used by 80% of the Fortune 500, Kafka brings numerous benefits to virtually every industry and opens up countless
new use cases, large and small.

Version `2023.2.0` update:

- Added new `SCRAM-SHA-256` and `SCRAM-SHA-512` authentication mechanisms.
